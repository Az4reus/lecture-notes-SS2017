# Overview, EIST #4
At the end of this lecture, I should be able to: 

- Understand the 8 most important issues in system design
- Understand the difference between nonfunction requirements and design goals
- Formulate typical design goal tradeoffs
- Understand and formulate a subsystem decomposition
- Have an understanding of the most common architectural styles.

## Eight Issues of System Design

1. **Identify Design Goals: **
   Additional Nonfunctional Requirements, design Trade-offs
2. **Subsystem Decomposition:  **
   Layers vs Partition, Arch. Style, Cohesion and Coupling. 
3. **Identify Concurrency:**  
   Identification of Parallelism (Processes, Threads)
4. **Hardware/Software Mapping:**  
   Idenfitication of nodes, special purpose systens, buy vs. build, network
   connectivity. 
5. **Persistent Data Management**  
   Storing Persistent Objects, Filesystem v Database
6. **Global Resource handling**  
   Access Control, ACL vs Capabilities, Security. 
7. **Software Control**  
   Monolithic vs Event-Driven vs Conc. Processes. 
8. **Boundary Conditions:**  
   Initialisation, Termination, Failure.
