# Overview
This document shall serve as a way to discern what lectures have been studied
and kept track of, to keep an overview. There are three courses, and about a
dozen and a half lectures each. This means things must be processed about 2-3
lectures each day, preferably every day including week-ends, with Anki cards to
boot. So in order to start this off the right way, a checklist for each lecture
is in order.

The total amount of lectures so far is _48_, which means I get away with about 2
lectures each and every single day with some buffer to spare for work. This
should be doable and prepare me aptly. 

The issue that adds to this is homework, of which there are about 10 per course.
This adds complexity to planning, but if I get one done every other day and
correct it myself, I should be on track. 

## Studying checklist
- Watched Lecture? 
- Took notes during, on shit that isn't immediately 200% obvious? 
- Created Anki cards in the appropriate course decks? 
- Reviewed said Anki cards? 
- Re-read the script and made it pretty enough to print and re-read on
  occasion?
- Sat down and worked on homework afterwards? This ain't no petting zoo homeboy.
